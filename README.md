# AI
AI code enables machines to perform intelligent tasks like decision-making and problem-solving by using algorithms, machine learning, and neural networks. It allows systems to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions. Over time, these systems can adapt and improve through learning from data and interactions.

Here we run the programs on the SWI Prologue
